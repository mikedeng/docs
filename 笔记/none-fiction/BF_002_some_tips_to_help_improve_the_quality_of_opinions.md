Here are some tips that can help you improve the quality of your opinions:

1. Understand how opinions are formed.

Like every other human being, you are constantly perceiving - that is, receiving data through your senses. Also like everyone else, you have a natural drive to discover meaning in your perceptions. That drive can be enhanced or suppressed, but it can never be entirely lost. In practical terms, this means that you cannot help producing opinions about what you see and hear whether or not you take control of the process. When you are not in control, your mental system operates in the uncritical default mode. Here is how that uncritical mode compares with the conscious and more conscientious critical thinking mode:

    Uncritical Default Mode: Perceive
    Critical Thinking Mode: Perceive

    Uncritical Default Mode: Let an opinion "come to mind"
    Critical Thinking Mode: Investigate the issue

    Uncritical Default Mode: Focus on information that supports the opinion
    Critical Thinking Mode: Consider alternative opinions

    Uncritical Default Mode: Embrace the opinion
    Critical Thinking Mode: Decide which opinion is most reasonable.

2. Resist the temptation to treat your opinions as facts.

This temptation can be powerful. Once you've formed an opinion, it is natural to bond with it much as a parent bonds with a baby. The more you call your opinion to mind and express it to others, the stronger the bond becomes. To question its legitimacy soon becomes unthinkable; Nevertheless, you can be sure that some of your opinions have been uncritically formed and therefore need to be challenged. The probelm is that you can't be sure which ones those are . The prudent approach is to question any opinion, even a cherished one, the moment evidence arises that suggests it is based on habit, impulse, whim , personal preference, or the influence of fashionable ideas rather than reality.

3. Monitor your thoughts to prevent the uncritical default mode from taking charge.

Whenever you begin forming impressions of a person, place, or situation, follow the advice of the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus: "Be not swept off your feet by the vividness of the impression, but say, 'Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are and what you represent. Let me try [test] you.'" This approach will prevent your impressions from hardening into opinions before you determine their reasonableness.

By following these three steps, you will gain control of your opinions, and that is a considerable advantage over having them control you.

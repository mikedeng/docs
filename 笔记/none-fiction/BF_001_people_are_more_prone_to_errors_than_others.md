Some people are more prone to errors than others.

First: Those who seldom reason at all, but think and act as those around them do - parents, heighbors, the clergy, or anyone else they admire and respect. Such people want to avoid the difficulty that accompanies thinking for themselves.

Second: Those who are determined to let passion rather than reason govern their lives. Those people are influenced only by reasoning that supports their prejudices.

Third: Those who sincerely follow reason, but lack sound, overall good sense, and so do not look at all sides of an issue. They tend to talk with one type of person, read one type of book, and so are exposed to only one viewpoint.

Fourth: To locke's list we should add one more type: those who never bother to reexamine an opinion once it has been formed. These people are often the most error prone of all, for they forfeit all opportunity to correct mistaken opinions when new evidence arises.
